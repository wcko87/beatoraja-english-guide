This page lists beatoraja-specific skins.

**Note:** You can mix and match skins. The skin is chosen separately for each menu type.
- For example, not many skins support the Course Result screen, so it might be worth picking up one of the skins that supports it just for the Course Result screen.

To search for skins for a specific menu, you can search for the menu type with Ctrl+F (e.g. Music Select, Decide, Result, Play, 7Keys, 9Keys, Course Result).

Not all of the skins listed have screenshots. That is because the author did not provide screenshots, and I am too lazy to take screenshots on my own. If anyone has tried those skins, it would be nice if you could contribute some screenshots.

**Note:** There is another list of beatoraja skins (in JP) here: https://w.atwiki.jp/laser_bm/pages/129.html

# Skin Modifications
This section lists unofficial skin modifications that some people have made.

More will be added to this section later on.

## LITONE5 Table Font Color Replacements
Replacement for the difficult-to-read black table font text that's in LITONE by default.
Pink text is made by Reasonance. The other colors were made by me.
- **NOTE:** These replacement files were from an older version of LITONE5. If you are using a more recent version of the skin, you may have to edit the `font.lr2font` file in the same folder and change the `.cim` extensions to `.tga`.

# Lunatic Rave 2 Skins

beatoraja supports the skin format used by LR2, which means that in theory, LR2 skins should work in beatoraja. However, there are many compatibility issues with LR2 skins when using them in beatoraja.

Generally, play skins should have less compatibility issues than music select skins.

This page lists both LR2 and beatoraja skins:
